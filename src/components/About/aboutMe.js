  'Hey There!',
  `I'm Sergi Romeu, and I was born, raised, and currently living in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.`,
  'Since I was a kid, I loved computers and everything related to technology, so when I was able to choose a career path, I went all-in with Software Development. Besides programming, I also like all kinds of music, DJ, gaming, sea-diving.',
  'I define myself as a friendly guy, team player, responsible, and perfectionist.',
  `One of the things I dealt with is having an updated CV to apply to jobs, so that's one of the reasons I created this website. I wanted something that would be easier to update over time, more than a photoshop template downloaded from the web, and also a challenge to create a small project to learn about other technologies I am not used with.`,
  `The other main reason is the possibility to skip the "technical test" when applying to a company, as nowadays, there are many companies that expect you to invest some days just to know if you are "worth it" for them, so having something reliable to prove my skills is the objective.`,
